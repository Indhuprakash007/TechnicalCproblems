# Pattern Programs in C

This repository contains various C programs to print different patterns using loops. Each file demonstrates a specific pattern, useful for learning nested loops and control structures in C.

## Folder Structure
- **Day1 - Day7**: Each folder contains C files for different days, focusing on various pattern problems.

## Example Patterns
- Inverted right triangle
- Space triangle
- X pattern (star and number)
- Butterfly pattern
- Swapping numbers
- Odd or even check
- Factorial, prime, sum of numbers, etc.

## How to Run
1. Open any `.c` file in your preferred C IDE or editor.
2. Compile using a C compiler, e.g.,
   ```sh
   gcc filename.c -o output.exe
   output.exe
   ```
3. Follow the prompts in the terminal (if any input is required).

## Purpose
These programs are intended for practice and learning basic C programming concepts, especially nested loops and conditional statements.
